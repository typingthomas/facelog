# WhoDis?

This is a lightweight live, local, facial recognition program that can run on Windows or Linux designed to identify known individuals in real time using a standard webcam.

## Description

I've written this project completley in python and have utilized the InsightFace library for facial recognition model and OpenCV + NumPy to help me gather the embeddings live and identify faces on the spot, it's able to run completley offline once configured and works well with old hardware and webcams that you might have laying around.
